   <h1>Research + Concept Development</h1>
   <p class="page-subhead">To inform my design choices throughout this capstone, I conducted user research to further understand my target audience and their pain points, priorities, and preferred formats for a guided or prompted photography journey. To do this, I organized my research into three categories: asking participants about their experience taking digital photos, taking film photos, and their preferences specific to the product and concept.

    <h1>Digital Photography</h1>

    <div class="graph-caption">
        <p>Users currently have an average of <em>14,721 photos</em> on their phones. However, <em>93% never or rarely get prints</em> of their photos.</p>

</div>

<div class="graph-caption">
    <p>When asked about their experience shooting <em>digital</em> photos, participants noted:</p>

        <div class="quote-wrapper">
        <p class="quotegallery neg">"I think you lose a bit of the quality for the quantity and ease. These photos can also <em>feel more generic and less intentional.</em>"</p>
        
            <p class="quotegallery neg">"Sometimes the opportunity to capture every moment as many times you would like ends up <em>taking away from the moment!</em>"</p>
            
            <p class="quotegallery neg">"<em>There’s such little connection to the photo.</em> They are all so disposable and unlimited that you don’t ever really have a memory associated with it."</p>
        
            <p class="quotegallery pos">"I like the ease of something in my pocket, <em>intuitive focusing</em>, etc."</p>
            
            <p class="quotegallery neg">"I don't remember to look back at them. <em>The sheer number of them is overwhelming.</em> I have to sort through ten copies to find the best one."</p>
        
            <p class="quotegallery pos">"Can edit them straight then and there. <em>Don't feel pressure to make them perfect.</em> Rapid fire. Snap things that I think I may want or need later, but no consequence if I don't."</p>

            <p class="quotegallery neg">"<em>It becomes mindless and going through photos can feel like a chore</em> because of how cluttered my photo app is"</p>
                
            <p class="quotegallery neg">"<em>I feel less creative with them!</em> Because I always have my phone on me, I often forget to take meaningful pictures."</p>

    <h1>Film Photography</h1>

    <!-- <p>Film photography has spiked in popularity, with _____ growth in ___ over the past ___ years.*</p> -->
    <div class="graph-caption">
    <p>When asked about their experience shooting <em>Film</em> photos, participants noted:</p>

    <div class="quote-wrapper">
        <p class="quotegallery pos">"I enjoy <em>the anticipation of developing photos to see how they really captured the moment.</em> It’s a framed, surprise memory."</p>
        
        <p class="quotegallery pos">"I like <em>the intention behind taking a film photo</em>, I’m often more thoughtful about the shot because I only have so many pics on a roll."</p>
        
        <p class="quotegallery neg">"I often become SO selective with my limited frames that <em>I don't end up taking pictures that I later wish I had.</em>"</p>

        <p class="quotegallery pos">"I love the look of film and in contrast to the convenience of my phone, <em>it forces me to slow down and really think about what I’m shooting.</em>"</p>
        
        <p class="quotegallery pos">"I enjoy <em>the delicacy of playing with light.</em> The surprise when film gets developed."</p>
            
        <p class="quotegallery pos">"...since I don't get the immediate feedback to know if a shot turned out "perfectly" (or, honestly, at all), <em>I tend to take a mental snapshot of the moment as well, just for myself.</em> That mentality has actually helped me be more present in the moment."</p>
        
        <p class="quotegallery neg">"I wish I felt more confident adjusting the exposure settings on my camera. <em>I love the idea of shooting film, but half the time my photos turn out poorly.</em>"</p>

        <p class="quotegallery pos">"It feels <em>more intentional than digital. It is more in the moment</em> and requires more thought about what goes into each photo."</p>
                
        <p class="quotegallery pos">"I also really love photo books. It’s very nostalgic to visiting my grandparents and going through baskets full of photo books that captured my family’s childhood. <em>I like having a Time Capsule for others to explore.</em>"</p>
    </div>
    </div>
<div class="graph-caption"> 
    <p>Thinking of what themed prompts would be most in demand, I was curious about the types of photos users typically enjoy taking. <em>Participants typically take photos of their friends and family</em>, as well as landscapes and nature. </p>

<div class="graph-caption"> 
    <img src="img/graph-rolls.png" alt="How many rolls users shot last year" class="half-full">
    <p>With thoughts of a potential subscription service, I was also curious about <em>how frequently participants shot and developed their rolls of film</em>. Most reported taking 2-4 rolls of photos last year.</p>
</div>
    <!-- <p>Additionally, when thinking about products to offer in the shop, I wanted to know how many participants owned reloadable cameras vs. those who shot disposables.</p>

    <h1>Capstone Concept Development</h1>

    <p>In my final survey section, I asked participants to weigh in on preferences and formats specific to my capstone concept, ISO Film Co.</p>
    
    <!-- <p>How would you feel about having prompts or themes guide you as you take photos?</p>
    <p>Scale from 1 (Strongly dislike, I don't want to feel told what to take photos of) to 5 (Strongly enjoy, I would love bringing more intentionality and inspiration as I take photos.)</p> -->
<div class="graph-caption"> 
    <p>When asked if users would prefer prompts for each photo frame or themes for each roll, <em>users strongly preferred themes for the whole roll.</em> In this way, they could keep a concept in mind and train their eye to look for shots throughout the roll.</p>
    <img src="img/graph-framevsroll.png" alt="Theme for roll 88.9%, Prompt per frame 11.1%." class="half-full">
</div> 
<div class="graph-caption">
    <img src="img/graph-abstractvsspecific.png" alt="Pie chart, Abstract 46.7%, Specific 26.7%, Both 26.7%" class="half-full">
    <p>Users were more torn on whether they preferred specific prompts that would focus on the subject of a photo, or abstract prompts focused on the feeling or emotion of a photo. <em>Based on this feedback, I opted to offer a mix of both,</em> but skew towards more abstract and conceptual prompts.</p>
</div>
<div class="graph-caption">
    <p>When I started my research, I had ideas for both a hybrid-digital experience (where prompts would be delivered via an app, random prompt generator, or to embed QR code to prompt within the packaging) and a purely analog experience (such as each order coming with a journal, a photo album, a zine guide, or to embed printed prompt within the packaging). <br> <br>Feedback from my user group heavily favored <em>keeping the experience analog</em> – the point would be to put your phones away and be present in the moment.</p>
    <img src="img/graph-digitalvsanalog.png" alt="Users strongly prefer to receive their prompts in an analog format over digital or hybrid" class="half-full">
</div>
<div class="graph-caption">
    <img src="img/graph-analog.png" alt="Breaking down the question further, of potential analog prompt formats, users preferred: 1. A zine or booklet, 2. Printed in Packaging, and 3. In a Photo Album" class="half-full">
    <p>Breaking down the question further, <em>a zine or embedded prompt within the packaging were the favored formats,</em> though several liked the idea of an album they could put prints in later.</p>
