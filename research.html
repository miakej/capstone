   <h1>Research + Concept Development</h1>
   <p class="page-subhead">To inform my design choices throughout this capstone, I conducted user research to further understand my target audience and their pain points, priorities, and preferred formats for a guided or prompted photography journey. To do this, I organized my research into three categories: asking participants about their experience taking digital photos, taking film photos, and their preferences specific to the product and concept.

    <h1>Digital Photography</h1>

    <p>Users currently have an average of <em>14,721 photos</em> on their phones. However, <em>93% never or very rarely get prints</em> of their photos.</p>

    <p>When asked about their experience shooting digital photos, participants noted:</p>

        <div class="quote-wrapper">
        <p class="quotegallery neg">"I think you lose a bit of the quality for the quantity and ease. These photos can also feel more generic and less intentional."</p>
        
            <p class="quotegallery neg">"Sometimes the opportunity to capture every moment as many times you would like, end up taking away from the moment!"</p>
            
            <p class="quotegallery neg">"There’s such little connection to the photo. They are all so disposable and unlimited that you don’t ever really have a memory associated with it."</p>
        
            <p class="quotegallery pos">"Ease of something in my pocket, intuitive focusing, etc."</p>
            
            <p class="quotegallery neg">"I don't remember to look back at them. The sheer number of them is overwhelming. I have to sort through ten copies to find the best one."</p>
        
            <p class="quotegallery pos">"Can edit them straight then and there. Don't feel pressure to make them perfect. Rapid fire. Snap things that I think I may want or need later, but no consequence if I don't."</p>

            <p class="quotegallery neg">"It becomes mindless and going through photos can feel like a chore because of how cluttered my photo app is"</p>
                
            <p class="quotegallery neg">"I feel less creative with them! Because I always have my phone on me, I often forget to take meaningful pictures."</p>

    <h1>Film Photography</h1>

    <p>Film photography has spiked in popularity, with _____ growth in ___ over the past ___ years.*</p>

    <p>When asked about their experience shooting digital photos, participants noted:</p>

    <div class="quote-wrapper">
        <p class="quotegallery pos">"I enjoy the anticipation of developing photos to see how they really captured the moment. It’s a framed, surprise memory."</p>
        
        <p class="quotegallery pos">"I like the intention behind taking a film photo, I’m often more thoughtful about the shot because I only have so many pics on a roll."</p>
        
        <p class="quotegallery neg">"I often become SO selective with my limited frames that I don't end up taking pictures that I later wish I had."</p>

        <p class="quotegallery pos">"I love the look of film and in contrast to the convenience of my phone, it forces me to slow down and really think about what I’m shooting. "</p>
        
        <p class="quotegallery pos">"I enjoy the delicacy of playing with light. The surprise when film gets developed."</p>
            
        <p class="quotegallery pos">"...since I don't get the immediate feedback to know if a shot turned out "perfectly" (or, honestly, at all), I tend to take a mental snapshot of the moment as well, just for myself. That freeze-frame mentality has actually improved my memory and awareness of moments over time."</p>
        
        <p class="quotegallery neg">"I wish I felt more confident adjusting the exposure settings on my camera. I love the idea of shooting film, but half the time my photos turn out poorly."</p>

        <p class="quotegallery pos">"It feels more intentional than digital. It is more in the moment and requires more thought about what goes into each photo."</p>
                
        <p class="quotegallery pos">"I also really love photo books. It’s very nostalgic to visiting my grandparents and going through baskets full of photo books that captured my family’s childhood. I like having a Time Capsule for others to explore."</p>

    <p>Curious about the subject of their photos, what participants enjoy (or are used to) shooting </p>
    <p>graph of what they shoot</p>
    <p>With thoughts of a potential subscription service, I was also curious about how frequently participants shot and developed their rolls of film. Most reported taking 2-4 rolls of photos last year.</p>
    <p>graph of answers?</p>
    <p>Additionally, when thinking about products to offer in the shop, I wanted to know how many participants owned reloadable cameras vs. those who shot disposables.</p>
    <p>Percentage Own // Percentage Disposables </p>

    <h1>Capstone Concept Development</h1>

    <p>In my final survey section, I asked participants to weigh in on preferences and formats specific to my capstone concept, ISO Film Co.</p>
    
    <p>How would you feel about having prompts or themes guide you as you take photos?</p>
    <p>Scale from 1 (Strongly dislike, I don't want to feel told what to take photos of) to 5 (Strongly enjoy, I would love bringing more intentionality and inspiration as I take photos.)</p>

    <p>Format for prompts: pie chart prompts for each photo vs. theme for each roll.</p>
    <p>Abstract vs. Specific</p>
    <p>Digital vs. Analog</p>
    <p>bar chart: further breakdown</p>
