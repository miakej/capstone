    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <p>I began user research to further understand my target audience and their pain points, priorities, and preferred formats for a guided or prompted photography journey. 
    </p>        
    <p>To do this, I organized my research into three categories: asking participants about their experience taking digital photos, taking film photos, and their preferences specific to the product and concept.

    <h1>Digital Photography</h1>

    <p>Users currently have an average of <em>14,721 photos</em> on their phones.</p>

    <p>However, <em>93% never or very rarely get prints</em> of their photos.</p>

    <h3>When asked about their experience shooting digital photos, participants noted:</h3>
    <div class="horizontal-wrapper">
        <div class="quote-wrapper">
        <p class="quotegallery neg">"I think you lose a bit of the quality for the quantity and ease. These photos can also feel more generic and less intentional."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="quote-wrapper">
            <p class="quotegallery neg">"Sometimes the opportunity to capture every moment as many times you would like, end up taking away from the moment!"</p>
            </div>
    
        <div class="quote-wrapper">
            <p class="quotegallery neg">"There’s such little connection to the photo. They are all so disposable and unlimited that you don’t ever really have a memory associated with it."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote-wrapper">
            <p class="quotegallery pos">"Ease of something in my pocket, intuitive focusing, etc."</p>
            </div>
    
        <div class="quote-wrapper">
            <p class="quotegallery neg">"I don't remember to look back at them. The sheer number of them is overwhelming. I have to sort through ten copies to find the best one."</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="quote-wrapper">
            <p class="quotegallery neg">"It becomes mindless and going through photos can feel like a chore because of how cluttered my photo app is"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="quote-wrapper">
            <p class="quotegallery pos">"Can edit them straight then and there. Don't feel pressure to make them perfect. Rapid fire. Snap things that I think I may want or need later, but no consequence if I don't."</p>
            </div>
    
        <div class="quote-wrapper">
            <p class="quotegallery neg">"I feel less creative with them! Because I always have my phone on me, I often forget to take meaningful pictures."</p>
